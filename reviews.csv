Paying a lower commission absolutely did NOT mean a lower standard of representation. We highly recommend Clever to anyone looking to sell their property.",2022-10-03,5

This was my second experience selling a house and my first in New York State.  I live out of state.  From cradle to grave our Broker Charles walked us through the process.  He was available via text and phone calls at all hours of the day and night to field our questions or concerns.  At times, I'm sure he felt like a therapist calming my sister or my concerns.  He even responded when he was on vacation and on weekends.  He made completing the contract easy, especially since my sister and I couldn't be physically present throughout 99% of the process.  I would recommend Charles as a Broker/Agent without reservation!",2022-09-30,5

She was not only amazing, but so knowledgeable with EVERYTHING, even unrelated buying and selling. I could go on about her but I'll save that for her review.Clever was great with their referrals and allowing us to make our own decisions. We started out with a sale of our property and ended up with a purchase as well. The concierge service checking on us to make sure that things were going well and offers of help in other ways was an added bonus. They were also very helpful in reminding us of changing over utilities and  advising us in other ways to help make our transitions easy.

Clever Real Estate,"I interviewed two realtors.  The first realtor wanted to set the asking price significantly below the market value.  I hired the second realtor as he appeared to understand the market and had some good ideas on how to market my house. In the end, I don't believe that he had my best interests in mind and did not represent me well in the negotiation process with the buyers realtor. He set the intial asking price too low and during the negotiation process with the buyers realtor he encouraged me to continue to accept a lower offer and to give additonal credits to the buyer. I believe his primary object was to just get the house sold as soon as possible regardless of how much it costs me in a lower price. In the end I believe I sold my house at below market value. Also, during the initial open house he showed up only minutes before when there were potential buyers waiting in their cars. He also convinced us that the 4th quarter of the year was a good time to list a house and that was not our experience as we did not have but one offer. Also, through out the process he would say one thing and then later say exactly the opposite and we concluded that we could not rely on him to provide us with accurate information. I would highly recommend that you use a different company other than Clever as I believe that the lower commission fee resulted in a lower quality realtor.",2022-12-14,1
Clever Real Estate,"Clever refered me to one of the best agents. Athrine is the best realtor/agent!  She cared and worked for her client's interests.  I had listed my home with another agent who could not secure the deal - the home was in and out the escrow 5 times.  Once the listing expired, I hired Arthine.  She educated me on the contract details and advised me throughout the selling process.  When buyers requested unreasonable terms or items, she handled it like a pro.  She was not an agent that will list your home and let it sit in the market waiting for buyers.  She did everything she could to sell my home even mowed the lawn and cleaned dust to prep the home in presentable condition.  If you are looking for an agent to buy or sell, go with Arthine.

Jeff explained Clevers' services thoroughly and answered all of my questions honestly based on his knowledge of my specific market. You see, Clever recommends names of local experienced licensed agents like Jeff who are very personable and genuinely represents your interest. WHO KNEW... TRUE STORY... KEEP READING..     I had contacted several agents prior to reaching out to Clever as many would not respond to my online inquires or took a week or so to return the call.     When I was lucky enough to get that returned call, I was surprised to hear that they would not sell properties valued under 300k, (Wait Whaaat??)  I was told the commissions on that amount were not high enough to justify their time NO JOKE. NEXT...I didn't realize that as a seller I could be denied service based on the purchase price... I was disheartened UNTIL I ran across an add for Clever....and  couldn't be happier that I took a chance on CLEVER.      I HAD NEVER HEARD OF THEM, honestly thought I was going to get second rate service based on the my flat rate of 3k    I WAS SO WRONG....SOOOO WRONG     I closed today and the entire process was smooth and stress free.

A crew of photographers came out to our property and took beautiful/professional quality pictures and videos of our home which that were posted online very quickly. We were impressed at how beautiful and eye-catching the listing was.We had our first offer in 4 days! We listed our home around Nov. 4 and we closed on Dec. 28.

Clever Real Estate,"What made my experience great was the concierge service.  Clever was in touch throughout the entire process and always willing to answer questions honestly and promptly.  We were overall satisfied with the agent we’ve chosen and would use her services even if it were a 6% commission.  One thing I’d like to remind people is to verify if there any other fees the real estate agent’s office charges on top of the commission.  In our case, there was a $600 office administrative fee we were charged, which we knew about before signing the contract.  We didn’t mind paying the fee because we assumed it was for the professional photos, lockboxes, etc.  But for some people this may be an issue.  As always, do your due diligence first.  Also, always be involved with the process.  Follow-ups are crucial, no matter how good your agent is—something is bound to be overlooked .  It’s never a bad thing to advocate for yourself.  We used Clever for selling and also used the same agent when we purchased our new home.  We are very pleased with their Cash Back Program.  We got back 2.2K in less than 3 weeks after closing on the new home.  All in all, we’ve paid only half of the 1% after getting the cash back.  It went straight to help painting our new home! We would definitely use Clever again and refer everyone we know personally!",2022-11-18,5

Clever Real Estate,"I’m not sure where to begin, so I will start with, how and why we collaborated with Clever.My husband and I recently became empty nesters.Our home is too big for the both of us. Beginning May 2022 after watching a t.v. commercial we reached out to another Internet Real Estate Agency.They gave us a “tentative” offer.I decided to reach out to the agent we bought (this) home from (we became friends during our buying transaction).I reached out, to get her opinion of this Online Real Estate Company and the offer they presented to us. She was adamant, as she passionately advised against us going the “online” route. Being friends, I valued her opinion but as a realtor I TRUSTED her opinion. She said, “we can get you way more if you list with us”.My husband and I discussed it and decided it was best to list with her.We signed a contract with her in May. We were promised we could “list” your house for “X” price.My husband and I were happy with those numbers and signed the contract right there and started the process of getting the house ready for the market.We were promised a Open House; that never happened. Communication was HORRIBLE!!We spoke with her in person a total of (3) times. 2 other times she sent realtors we didn’t even know. During one of those visits he suggested to ‘reduce’ our asking price by $18,000. My husband questioned this proposal.Bewilderingly he asked, “why would we start at such a low asking price, you can’t go up from there, only down?”The agent replied, “we could have a bidding war. I just had one, a few weeks ago and got $12k over asking”.Again, we reluctantly agreed. Trusting that they are the ones with certificates and experience, they wouldn’t steer us wrong. Well….that was amiss and a HUGE aberration on our part.It was a stressful living nightmare until we mutually agreed to cancel contract the end of July. I was stressed to the max at this point. Panicking; because we had wasted 3mo. believing she would facilitate & promote the sale of our home while guiding & assisting us on what she needs and ways to make our home stand out. As soon as our contract was voided, I began the FSBO route. While researching tips, rules and state laws, I came across the website ‘Clever’.They help you with the FSBO route.As I was reading the website, I noticed that they also HELP to find you a *Top Notch* Real Estate Agent in your area at a reduced commission rate!!I showed my husband the website, he said;”reach out, at this point, what could it hurt?”I completed the form and it wasn’t 10-15min later I received a text message from Julie.We arranged to meet the following evening. When I say this woman was PREPARED, she was Planned & Prepped.She knew how many houses were for sale in our area and price range. She was confident and assured of her ability to sell our home for our asking price.She has ALWAYS been 1 phone call or text away. She has communicated and explained every part of this process to my husband and I.Julie has been so supportive and genuine with her intentions and motives.You can tell she really cares about her clients.Julie wants what is best for them, she is open and honest from start to finish. Julie has made this extremely STRESS FREE for us. This is WHY Clever is AMAZING. Julie: -Gave a ✔️list of what we needed to do. -Professionaly Photographed our home.-Listed our Home-Our home was shown over 40x-Weekend Openhouse -Offer-Contract-Inspections-Appraisal -Closing Scheduled ALL IN 17 DAYS!!*****YES*****17 DAYS!!My husband & I cant thank CLEVER enough for bringing Julie into our lives! Julie is a ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️I am sincere, she is TOP NOTCH in our book. She knows what the hell she is doing and her GAME plan is spot on.She knowledgeable and confident.We would definitely use her again and we we WILL be RECOMMENDING her to EVERYONE we know!! Buying or Selling!!We MOST certainly will be recommending Clever  to ANYONE that asks how we sold our home.This was literally so STRESS FREE!

Clever Real Estate,"They treat their referral agents very badly, realtors beware :( you can easily find a local agent who will offer you the same rate clever does. The owner harassed and threatened me in 2020, the morning I was going into surgery over a $900 check I had sent them twice already that they had lost or misfiled. Their response to this review is pretty typical, trying to shift blame back to the agents they're basically exploiting. It's also not just a 1% fee for the seller, they will ask you to pay buyers agent fee, so deceptive marketing practices as well. Google the owners of clever,stop giving middle man cuts to trust fund mega bros. Best of luck!",2022-09-17,1

Clever Real Estate,"Best Experience of my life related to selling property. I took the time and effort to analyze the market to source a agent /broker to sell my wife’s and my Condo. This process passed a test of resilience on my part as I interviewed six agents before ending in a decision between a 3 year experienced male agent versus 21 years experienced agent. The women and younger guy team did not cut it for me. The choice I made was due to multiple factors, also because my matching agent had clicked on all accounts with my liking. My agent Tim was also matched to me by Clever Real Estate. I think I would most certainly use Clever RE again if needed to buy or sell in the future. Highly recommended based on my positive profitable experience.",2022-09-03,5

Clever Real Estate,My husband and I had a wonderful experience selling our house with Clever. The house was sold in the first open house. I truly would recommend Clever if you want to save money selling your home.,2022-08-15,5
Clever Real Estate,"Hello all Please don't waste your time with these scam artists.  Contracts mean nothing to them. The realtor I was matched with promised professional photos, a for sale sign, lock box, flyers,  digital furnishings,  areal pictures and open houses. My house has been on the market over 2 weeks and I have had nothing but the pictures. I was also told they would not be doing any open houses.  The market is dropped fast and I'm already losing money by my realtor not doing his job and sticking to the binding and legal contract.  When I contacted clever to step In and rectify the situation this is what they told me""I hope this email finds you well. We're reaching out in regards to your concerns about having open houses with your property. We were wondering if having an open house was a dealbreaker for you. If not, your agent, Sean, will be more than happy to continue your working relationship. If it is, in fact, a dealbreaker, we can completely understand and you are welcome to contact Sean to discuss ending the agreement.Please note at this time, we do not have very many agents in your area and we are uncertain if we would be able to find another agent.Please let us know if you have any questions. Thank you so much and we hope you have a great weekend!""So basically that leaves me with 3 options.  1.Allow my realtor to continue to screw me over, 2 cancel the contract and start over even though the markets dropped considerably and 3 call my lawyer and hold them accountable. Neither one of those sound grand so I urge you to look elsewhere,  the customer service is clearly sub par and the selected realtors are definitely a hit or miss. Don't get stuck in my dilemma look elsewhereI'm sure it's worth the money to pay more rather then spend on legal fees in the long run. Anyway that's my 2 cents. Good luck and happy selling/buying",2022-08-13,1

Clever Real Estate,"My husband and I made the decision to hire an agent through Clever when we sold our home in Central Florida. We had spoken with agents 2 years prior, before things got weird (2020), and had a fairly good idea of what we could negotiate when it came to agent fees. We were close to listing FSBO when my husband came across Clever. The discounted seller’s fees were what attracted us and ultimately swayed our decision. Had we listed by owner we would have spent close to the same on legal fees and we’d have to deal with everything ourselves. Once we requested info we were scheduled to speak by phone with 2 agents. Elizabeth and I had great rapport over the phone and we ultimately chose her to represent us. While that time was incredibly stressful, Elizabeth gave us her honest opinion and feedback, backed up by data. We had offers in a matter of hours, under contract within days, closed in 30, and received above asking price! Never regretted making the decision to use Clever. Everyone I’ve spoken with was friendly and professional and Elizabeth got us to the closing table. Thank you!!",2022-08-13,5

Clever Real Estate,"I found clever while trying to find ways to save money while selling and buying a home. I thought they sounded too good to be true, but they really are as good as they sound! We had incredible realtors both for selling and buying - they were quick to respond, communicated well, took amazing pictures, staged our home, and the realtor out in Utah went to homes for us, walked us through each home via facetime, responded to our concerns, helped educate us, and so much more. I will also say that it probably depends on the realtor you get. Clever gave us two options in both locations (in MD where we sold our home and in UT where we bought our home). And in each location, one realtor really stood out and that was the one we chose. I like that clever gives you options though and they say that if you don't feel great about the first two options, they'll give you more. Luckily for us, we found someone great within the first two options and we saved a ton of money and had a great experience.",2022-08-03,5

Clever Real Estate,"I came across Clever by accident while I was surfing online for a real estate agent to help us sell our home. What attracted me to Clever was their 2% commission (as opposed to the usual 6% from other real estate companies). After all, who doesn’t want to save money? Then as I read further on their website that the customers will still get full service from their agents inspite of the lower commission, I was sold. Clever then sent me the names of 3 potential agents and arranged a meet with them. My husband and I decided on Victor Lee because we were impressed by his preparedness and the amount of research he did and presented to us in our first meeting. We knew then that we were going to be in good hands with him and we were right. Victor guided us through the anxiety and stress of preparing our home for listing, always available to answer our questions, his invaluable advice along the way, and his constant communication to keep us up-to-date which we greatly appreciated.

In today’s market, I believe it is unreasonable to ask a homeowner to pay 6% of the value of their home in order to sell it. Be sure to talk with each of your recommended agents, and even ask for others, if you are not comfortable with an agent, keep interviewing them until you are. The first agent we talked to was not honest, and we moved on to find a perfect match!",2022-06-28,5

We had alot of work to do on the property inside and out so if less commision paid out it would help us alot. Noticed Clevers Ads and thought at least meet with an agent and see. We ended up with the best agent I have ever worked with. Ron Smith with Keller William and his Island Team. It wasn't easy sorting thru buyers, escalation clauses, bank appraisals alot lower than current market prices. Ron Smiths guidance thru some chaotic times right on. It took a few tries to close. We got way more that we ever thought for our property. Clever was the right choice. Neighbors selling now want our agent. So Ron will get more listings.

I set up interviews with each of the realtors and then chose Ryan from Remax. He was excellent, showed up with a plan and had really researched my house and area. Ryan had beautiful pictures and drone footage done of the property, he held an open house and listed it online.  I feel like we received the same attention and got all the perks of using a realtor, just at a smaller commission.  Ryan ended up representing our buyer as well.  He was able to handle the deal, logistics of out of state buyers, and all the closing documents.  I recommend Ryan and Clever over and over again.

We offered 2% to buyers agents, so ended up paying half of normal fees.I think either broker we chose would’ve been excellent, and the service we received was absolutely the same as if we had paid full price. there’s no reason to go to a cut rate broker or pay full price again.",2022-06-02,5

Clever Real Estate,"I was in a somewhat unique situation when looking to sell my house.  I was overbuilt for the neighborhood which didn’t have many comps as it was. Also, I didn’t know of any realtors in the area that I wanted to trust with this situation let alone invest a 6% commission, but thought it might just work, or I could at least try, with this Clever system that was new to me.  Well I couldn’t have been more thrilled with the results!!I was given two realtors to choose from at the start (with more to look at if these weren’t what I was looking for). I interviewed both and was very pleased!  Both had really done their homework and were truly interested in the property.  I would have felt very confident in choosing either one!  I felt one had more of the approach I was looking for so I went with them.  The one I didn’t choose was graceful about it and I would work with her in a second and highly recommend her to others. The process went very smoothly and we were listed quickly.  I had felt very heard by the realtor I chose as we set the price. We got a full value offer right away, even before the open house!!  Unfortunately the county had assessed my property with incorrect square footage and listed it as fact.  (Realtors must list with this square footage fact.) This eventually led to us dropping the sale (the buyer’s appraiser took advantage of the situation and tried to force/bully a ridiculously low-ball price).  Back on the market we got several offers right away and went with an all cash offer that closed within two weeks.  It wasn’t the full listing price but fair given the square footage discrepancy and the time it would take to go through weeks and months of more appraisal assessments for lenders.  I was very happy and it really met the needs of the couple buying the home, so a win/win.  I could not have been happier and more impressed than I was with my realtor!!  He was so knowledgable and professional and had the utmost resources at his disposal throughout the whole process.  He always assured me they would work just as hard as if I were paying full commission and they certainly did.  He really knew his stuff and never missed a beat when we ran into the snags.  He always told me where things stood and gave me the time to make my decisions.  I always felt he was ethical and working for the best possible outcome for all, but mostly me since I was indeed his client. I was able to take a chance on and even make the sale due to the lower costs of Clever, yet through Clever I found a realtor that I would now absolutely pay 6% to use!  I truly had a five star experience and would highly recommend Clever!",2022-04-25,5
Clever Real Estate,Way to go. Market is changing. Buying & selling RE must change also.,2022-04-23,5
Clever Real Estate,"Clever hooked me up with realtor Dianne, and she ran with it. Hiring Dianne is easily the best decision I made in the long months of selling my home. I'm a university faculty member, so I'm in the business of evaluation and critique. I'm hard to satisfy. I expect people to disappoint me. However, from beginning to end, Dianne was my ally and expert in getting the most out of my home sale. She was helpful, friendly, knowledgeable, thorough, and a bulldog when it came to negotiation. While I was selling in Phoenix I was also buying in Houston, and throughout that Houston purchase I repeatedly thought, ""Dang, I wish Dianne was handling this deal, too."" She would have headed off problems or knocked some heads, same as she did for my sale. Hats off to Dianne, and to Clever for putting us together.",2022-04-22,5

Clever Real Estate,I actually did end up paying way less to the sellers agent using clever. Never got the impression from the agent I was getting minimum service due to the lower fee. I would certainly use again if they had realtors in the area,2022-04-19,5
Clever Real Estate,could not tell any difference in service as an agent until you get to closing table and see flat rate for services vs 6%,2022-04-19,5

Clever Real Estate,"Clever is a life saver. To have a full service concierge service help guide my selling process of my home is the thing I didn't know I needed until now. I wish I'd known about them years ago. They made me feel safe and heard throughout, and I truly appreciated that. The agent that they found for me, was the best agent I've worked with in my years of real estate transactions. I will always use her from now on.",2022-04-17,5
Clever Real Estate,"If you're reading this review, then you're probably wondering whether Clever is a legit company.  I can tell you firsthand that they are.  This is how I see it.  The real estate game is an incredibly competitive game.  Agents need business, and in return for more business some of them are more than willing to take on new clients at a lower percentage with the understanding that they can make up for it with volume.  It's simple economics.  Best of all, in order to stay on Clever's list of agents, they have to do their job well. If you're considering just picking an agent based on their picture/profile online then you're making a big mistake. For most agents, you're a one and done. If they don't do a good job for you, then maybe you won't be a good referral for them down the road.  But so what?  You're one person. With Clever, the agents recognize that if they do their job well, then you will review them positively with Clever and Clever will keep them on their list of agents.  As long as they're on that list, the referrals will keep rolling in and they'll continue to do solid business.  Best of all, you're getting their service at 4% instead of 5-6%. Do the math.  My agent was phenomenal, and with Clever it was a win-win-win. I absolutely recommend them. Honestly, when you reach out to them, the hardest part is choosing a realtor from the list they provide. They are all.kore than capable, you just choose the one that works best with you.",2022-04-15,5

We were only on the market for 3 days! Can’t recommend this service enough. It saved us a nice chunk of change at closing. Just make sure to confirm that they have the numbers right before signing contracts.,2022-04-15,5
Clever Real Estate,Can't tell you how glad I am that we went this route. Now for everyone curious this is EXACTLY the same service if you went and got your own agent. Clever paired us with some local realtors. Each one came by for what I considered an interview. We picked Jason Reynolds who is with remax in our Denver area. He was amazing and in the end I put another 8-10k in my pocket so it basically covers closing costs on the next home. 5 Stars.,2022-04-15,5

Clever Real Estate,"I discovered Clever in a roundabout way on the internet, searching for ways to save money (safely and reliably) as a seller of a home in a distant location from our primary home. When I read about Clever I looked at reviews and ratings; everything was positive. I contacted Clever; the process was swift, professional, seamless. We chose one of the two realtors suggested, after interviewing both remotely the following day. The Clever selections were both excellent for our circumstances; it was nearly a flip of a coin to select one over the other. From there it was full speed ahead to a great sale that closed 4 weeks from the time I contacted Clever.",2022-04-14,5
Clever Real Estate,"Negotiating a ""discount rate"" on one of the most important transactions you may make in your lifetime, should give you pause, and it did for me. The truth is, this is a VERY aggressive sellers market, with a paucity of inventory. My agent wasn't new or inexperienced, just hungry and savvy with regards to marketing. We offered 2.5% to the buyers agent as well as the 1% to the our agent. This added up to a HUGE savings. We accepted an ""above asking price offer."" within hours of the first showing! I do not feel that we received any less attention or effort. Jermaine ""earned"" our business, and I would recommend him at ""full price"" to anyone without hesitation.",2022-04-13,5

Clever Real Estate,"Holly Cole and her team were assigned by Clever to market and sell our vacation home.  The 1% sales commission was the drawing card that caused us to choose Clever.  We live 21/2 hours away from our central Oregon vacation home and consequently did not know any local realtors.  Clever could not have chosen a better sales team than Holly Cole's Central Oregon Home Pros of Keller Williams Real Estate Firm. Their team always went way above and beyond to get the job done correctly.  That manifested itself in small ways like being punctual, leaving notes for repair people, getting keys to the right people and straightened areas to show better.  Also, they always kept us informed of important dates to ensure a quick closing.  They are the best!",2022-04-12,5

Clever Real Estate,"I had a great experience with Clever Real Estate. I would recommend using this company for buying or selling real estate. The benefit for me was the discounted commission fee and the full range of services to sell my property. I did not need to interview other agents beyond my first two candidates for a good fit. I met with them at the property. They shared their ideas about selling the property. Both real estate brokers were knowledgeable about the market and my potential buyers so it was a difficult decision to choose one. Everything was smooth from start to finish. I meet with my broker on Tuesday, professional photos were taken on Friday, the listing went up on Monday, property shown to potential buyers for one week, offers were made and acceptance at the end of the first week. From that point, we followed a checklist of signing the documents, opened escrow, provided necessary sale contract docs, did termite inspection, professional cleaning, and escrow closed.....in 40 days. My broker took care of the transaction expertly and it was painless. I honestly can't believe how stress-free and efficient the entire transaction was...especially since I'm dealing with other stress life issues. I followed my instincts and called Clever Real Estate after hearing an advertisement on the radio. I figured ""what do I have to loose?"" I was stuck not knowing how to proceed with the details and representation but I wanted to save on commission fees. Looking back, its interesting how the chain of events fell into place and I'm so grateful......I followed the light at the end of the tunnel. Cleverly, I sold my property.",2022-04-07,5

They took Ariel drone pictures also.I just can’t say enough of how pleased We are. We got full asking price. We can’t believe we’re able to get that much for our home.

While waiting for that to be resolved, I started looking around on the Internet to see what other options we had. After researching one or two other companies I came across across Clever. That is when our entire selling experience changed!I entered our information and within minutes two agents were referred to me. Within an hour I was speaking to someone who was impressive from the start and lives a few miles away.  We met her at our home and signed an agreement approximately two days later. She advised us that our original price was below market and she felt we could get at least $30,000 more.  Within seven days we had an offer on our home that was above asking price!! Our agent had so many contacts and access to approved buyers that she didn’t even have to put it on the MLS! Even though this was a discounted commission deal, there was absolutely nothing discounted about the service we received. Our agent was professional, and timely, and responsive. If she couldn’t take a phone call she texted us immediately and then called us right back when she was available. It didn’t matter what time of day or night we reached out, she responded.The folks at Clever reached out several times to see how things were going. They even assigned me a personal concierge!

Overall, we were able to sell our house quickly and over asking - we couldn’t have been more pleased with our experience!",2022-02-24,5
Clever Real Estate,I found Clever online and was given two agents to connect with.  I chose Robert Guth from ReMax and couldn't be happier.  He was professional but friendly.  He took amazing video and pictures of my property. The whole experience was awesome.,2022-02-23,5
Clever Real Estate,The realtor I was paired with was EXCELLENT. At first I worried she might not have the experience because she seemed so young but she was perfect for me. She knew where I needed help and when I didn’t and she found information for me. If she didn’t know the answer to my question she always found out and would always contact me within 12-24hrs!!,2022-02-23,5

Clever Real Estate,"Over the last 40 years we have purchased or sold rental and our primary residence. Each transaction we used a different Realtor, company. Generally,  we were pleased with service provided but always hated the commission. For so long the standard 6% was the norm and finally competition lowered these ridiculous commissions. Not sure way it took so long to demand a lower commission, but after seeing ad after ad I finally looked into companies offering lower rates. No doubt, I was a little skeptical but after contacting Clever who did what they promised, and set me up with several local realtors I did phone interviews then decided who was the best fit and schedule a meet and greet. The local firm I picked did a fantastic job and we accepted an offer one week before MLS. Blown away and after negotiating a total 3% commission saved thousands of $’s. Tickled because sale was a investment property and my savings will be used to ease capital gains. Lastly, my brother will be selling a multi million property so I encourage him to use Clever. The only risk to you is if you do a poor job selecting a realtor that’s on you. But my experience is they work hard making sure local agencies are the best in you area. If you end up with a bad agent it’s likely they won’t last a single transaction. So, super pleased with entire process and recommend Cleaver. Saved about 20k, that’s a lot in my book. Good luck!",2022-02-22,5
Clever Real Estate,Cleaver is an awesome company. I used them to sell my investment home every step was an easy process. I loved the agent I worked with she was awesome and very informative. I will definitely use them again with my other properties.,2022-02-21,5

They had the office organized, ready for offers, and all the information I needed along the way was shared timely. They made sure I didn't miss any deadlines. Clever was there for support in the background throughout the entire process. It was selling without a realtor but having the office to help with the details. Much better than selling for a full 6%. Thank you Clever for your expertise!",2022-02-19,5
Clever Real Estate,"The Clever Real Estate program worked exceptionally well for me. They referred an agent in my area (Cathi Caldwell) within 24 hours and my house was listed and sold very quickly. Cathi teams up with her daughter, Bailey Olsen, so I had two great agents working on my behalf. Everything went well, from the initial meeting to negotiations and closing. It was truly a pleasure working with Cathi and Bailey. They are a top notch dynamic duo: friendly, professional, knowledgeable of the market, and always responsive to my questions. When issues came up during inspections, Cathi had resources available to quickly address and resolve the issues. When the appraisal didn't come in high enough to fully support financing for the buyer's offer price (which was 5% over the listing price), Cathi did a great job of negotiating a middle ground that both parties could accept. I don't have a lot of experience with real estate transactions, but Cathi and Bailey were far and away the best agents I have worked with and I would highly recommend them and the Clever Real Estate program to anyone.",2022-02-18,5

Clever Real Estate,"Clever had good, impartial information on its website about real estate agents. They provided a couple of options for agents in my area. I chose one, who accepted my listing for the advertised rate of a rock-bottom 1%. He did a good job selling my house, making the same effort as he would have for a regular 2.5-3%, and who I was fully satisfied with. And for my high-end house, I saved an enormous amount of money in commissions.This contrasts with discount brokers, which actually have higher commissions and poorer service.",2022-02-13,5

I was concerned that there would be hidden fees, she assured me that there weren’t. The realtor contacted me within 24 hours. The realtor explained things to me . She went to see the house that day and gave me a suggested listing price if I chose to list with her. I chose Tanya , the realtor and signed the listing agreement .

He was at my home within 4 hours of my initial contact. I listed right away because of his knowledge and professionalism. Jonathan was in constant contact.

Clever Real Estate,"Back in November, my mother in-law unexpectedly passed away leaving behind her home. The home was in a highly sought after area outside of seattle, but needed work. We had never sold a home before and had absolutely no idea what we were doing, but had a general idea of what housing in that area was going for. Well, the first realtor we dealt with wanted to ask for half of what it was worth and we never actually dealt with him personally, always his assistant (who was lovely but it didn’t make us feel very comfortable about his commitment to helping us). A friend of mine who is a real estate agent in the state we live in told me to check out Clever. Once I was in contact, they quickly paired us with several very attentive prospective agents, we decided on one that specialized in probate and estate sales. She was absolutely amazing. The day the house was listed it was sold and for quite a bit more than we expected. I seriously can’t recommend Clever enough. I wish we had known about them sooner.",2022-01-31,5

Clever promptly provided the name and number of a local realtor.  The realtor was slow to respond initially, and Clever said they could provide a different contact, but communications improved so I stuck with the initial assignment.  The entire process was very organized and efficient and closing was only three days later than the original estimate.  All monetary proceeds were deposited into my account in a timely manner.  I never had to leave my house - all transactions were completed online, or a representative was sent to my home.  It was an easy, stress-free process.  I highly recommend Clever.",2022-01-25,5

Clever Real Estate,"My agent assigned by Clever led me to believe that he had special tools and algorithms to maximize the price of my property. His initial CMA showed a price that was aspirational to me and compared favorably to other agents' estimates. Upon signing with him, he immediately told me that the market had magically softened, and I needed to list substantially less than we first agreed. Upon asking for some backup on where his data was coming from, he immediately backed down and said, “I just estimate the price”. So, he then went with the price negotiated down somewhat, but not all the way, from what he first proposed. Upon having someone else take photos and poorly ""virtually stage"" the unit in non-sensical arrangements of furniture, we listed. Did I mention the property description on the MLS was filled with grammatical errors?  Yeah, poor written English for my agent.  Three whole weeks later, he finally held an open house, the only one in 6 months of our engagement. Thirty or so days in, I asked him where we could move the price to generate more interest and he again just estimated and when asked to provide data of any sort, failed to do so. Despite this, we dropped the price.  Again, no open house, no follow ups, and I don’t think he even attends showings or visits the property to be sure it’s locked.  I went to my property one day and found, after a rainstorm, that the windows to the property were left open and the floors were wet from where rain blew into the unit. Thankfully there was no damage.  After ninety days on the market, I asked if we could have another open house, combined with a price reduction and a more thought out marketing plan.  No clear or real response followed. I chose to pay to cancel our engagement and in the spring I will list with a real agency.  Yeah, it’ll cost $4k more but they’ll be sure to help avoid $25,000 in price decreases after being misled on the potential for the property.",2021-12-31,2

Clever Real Estate,"My agent was the best.  She's a top producer & I got a deal using her.  She ended up facilitating the buyer's side too when their inept agent couldn't get anything done.  When the buyer's agent was incommunicado, my agent worked to get the deal closed & on time.  She's a go getter.I feel fortunate I got a top performing professional at a bargain price.  The market changed to a softer market so I feel good knowing that I saved on commissions as prices dipped from the frenzy early this year.",2021-09-18,5

One was from Rhode Island and I'm selling in Massachusetts. She's over an hour away and is she realistically going to be able to show our house when required? The other two were Real Estate investment firms whose objective is to get the lowest price possible. In my case the old adage still rings true, ""you get what you pay for.""",2021-09-14,3

Clever Real Estate,"Given the hot sellers market in our area I considered selling our house myself. However, after researching the topic I decided perhaps a hybrid selling approach was worth considering. I am glad I did. Clever set us up with two excellent, experienced and highly rated realtors in our area. After talking with both, as well as a full cost realtor, we settled on our realtor of choice - Leena. In summary - she was amazing. There were no short cuts, no feeling like we were getting anything but top notch service, knowledge and experience. Using Clever we saved about $5,000.

Knowing what is involved in the selling of a home, I didn't want to overpay by paying a 3% commission to a selling agent. After seeing an ad for Clever, I did a little research on the company. I decided this was the way to go and I couldn't be happier. Clever put me in contact with two highly qualified agents with several years of experience. They were both terrific and only difficult part of the process was choosing which one to go with. After making a decision, the agent came out with a professional photographer and took beautiful pictures of my home. Within 48 hours of putting the house on the market we had several offers.

The pandemic slowed my search down, but Clever found a capable agent for me who stuck with me and was able to help me find a home that my wife and I love. Clever was working behind the scenes and I worked with my agent to purchase my new home.  Based on past experience with a non-rebate agent, I received a higher level of service previously, but this was perfect for me and it was great to get 0.5% of the home price back just a week after closing.  I had the rebate check emailed to me- it felt weird but worked like a regular check.",2021-09-03,5

Clever Real Estate,"I thought my agent, Terri did an excellent job.  When you decide to go with an agency that doesn't charge a full commission, you wonder what type of sevice or agent you may get.  I couldn't have been happier.  This was the 8th house we've sold so we've dealt with a lot of agents over the years.  This was one of the better experiences.  There was nothing missing by using Clever.  The listing was placed in the MLS, Zillow, showings were conducted by the agent along with facilitating the proper paperwork.  Full service at a great price.  Thank You!",2021-08-26,5
Clever Real Estate,"The agent from clever was great.... Very knowledgeable easy to get along with, and they're every step of the way. The problem that we ran into is that I was selling the house to Open Door. Open Door I see difficult to work with... Everything is by text and or links that don't work. Then after they make you the offer they do the bait and switch... Their basic concept is very good, their customer service stinks, don't have two people on the same page, one tells you one thing one tells you something else and they never return a phone call. One of the worst experiences in selling the house that I've ever had and I've been a real estate agent for 28 years and saw every nightmare out there.... Chris kept his cool, and walked us through it. Not knowing if he was going to get paid by open door or not. Because their contract is so vague on when they pay it is very lopsided, and the closing attorney works for them so he's useless also.... Don't recommend open door to anybody. But would recommend clever real estate services...",2021-08-26,5

I think we spent a total of 5 days actively on market.As for our Indy agent, we had a ton of competition with the craziness of the market right now. We were also on a time crunch with having our condo under contract. Our agent did an excellent job of helping our offers standout in comparison to others. Surprisingly we only had to offer on two homes before going under contract.The best part is, we saved thousands of dollars on our sale AND received a $1,000 in cash back after closing on our Indy home.

Clever Real Estate,"I was skeptical about hiring an agent to sell this home.  I/we had intended to sell it ourselves.  A home that had been owned for almost 41 years by the little old lady from Pasadena, our mother! Her get-away home from the L A Basin, and later her little retiree fortress of green serenity. This is a great house, great bones, but it had a couple of issues. The kitchen and bathrooms had not been updated and… rooms had been added thru the life of the house that the City was not advised of. So, being put in charge of this task, I had done a lot of research and taken pictures, hired a professional photographer to take pictures and was ready to start marketing the house myself/ourselves, but I was a bit unsure. …. the super-hot market, bidding wars, being from out of state and California makes things harder just because…lol… then the COVID issues too. So…. I decided to hire help and everyone agreed. Through Clever Real Estate, I found Amir Khadir.  Because he is in Temecula, I was hesitant at first. He’s not local. He shared with me, he has sold many properties here (Coachella Valley) and was familiar with the area. He is remarkably diverse in the areas he covers and is deeply knowledgeable in each area.I stated very clearly my objectives and the needs of our family. He seemed to understand and needing to move forward, I put my trust in him and signed him on as my Agent! I never regretted for one second the decision I made. It was actually, the BEST decision I made. Thru getting this property ready to show, thru the contract(s), to the close, Amir’s handling of every situation that arose in his calm and levelheaded fashion. Each time he was right on the money. He was so helpful and truly masterful in staying focused when a couple of issues with the house came up. His understanding of the business and selling property is so apparent, knowing the ins and outs. He handled every detail. Check and rechecked on the work in progress along the way. Never a moment without communication. Text, email, phone calls. Always involved always informed and always aware and on top of the situation. This is my way of doing business and was so pleased to work with a PROFESSIONAL! He is also kindred friend that touches your life. Thank you for all your hard work and follow thru.Funny, everyone I met and knew, KNEW a realtor out there. I received the Perfect Realtor for me and my family in hiring Amir Khadir.

Clever Real Estate,"In June of 2021, decided to sell my condo owned for 8 years in the Everett WA area therefore was interested in saving on Real Estate sales commissions since the market was so hot it seemed like a good time.  I looked at a variety of options to sell in a short time and with little to no stress without giving away a lot of money for sales commissions.  Some options were to sell outright to companies that gouge with paying not only 6% but additional commission to ""prepare"" the property to sell sometimes paying up to 8-10% for all commissions.  After researching I decided to try Clever Real Estate since their business model seemed to fit what I was looking for.  I contacted them via their website and almost immediately was contacted by a representative to discuss my situation.  I was impressed with the friendliness and quick response from their representative who asked me a few questions then provided two real estate points of contact in the area where my condo is located.  The main reason I contacted Clever is because they offer reduced rates on sales commissions through a network of real estate agents.  Clever provided me the names and almost immediately the agents reached out to me and provided links to their sites which allowed me to check out who they were along with their businesses.  Within a day both agents texted, emailed and called me to discuss my situation and answer any questions about them and their business.  I decided to go with Lance Otto and Associates since they were located close to my condo and most of their business was based in the general area.  Lance and associates are professional, knowledgeable, friendly, great communicators and offered reduced commissions saving me literally many thousands of dollars.  Lance and I reviewed recent sales and newly listed to settle on an asking price.  Lance and associates walked me through the process, took pictures, listed property and coordinated viewings.  They took care of everything, low stress for me and everything went without a problem, they were excellent at customer service, communication, and kept in contact through the whole process from start to finish.  I've worked with a lot of agents through the years and Lance Otto and Associates set the standard for customer service in a real estate transaction, in my mind, because Clever Real Estate put me in contact with Lance and associates.  Both companies have fantastic people to work with, great customer service, great communicators all done in a timely manner with little to no stress all while saving thousands of dollars in sales commissions.  Strongly suggest using Clever to start your real estate journey and if you live in WA state, contact Lance Otto and Associates, they are the best!",2021-07-12,5

Clever Real Estate,"A few months ago we planned to move to a new house and sell our old house at Fairfax, VA afterwards. Since the market has been favorable to sellers, we didn't expect to need a lot of help from a listing realtor. So we found the low-commission option of Clever Real Estate. We received two responses, and selected the more experienced realtor Mr. Jonathan Granlund from REAL Broker, LLC. He did what we really needed within the low-commission limitation very professionally, and sold our house in one and half months (closed). We strongly recommend Clever Real Estate, and Mr. Granlund either via Clever or directly.",2021-07-02,5

Clever Real Estate,"The first two agents Clever Real Estate connected with us were not very familiar with our immediate area, but Clever responded to our concern immediately and efficiently  It only took an email, and they referred us to an expert local agent, Juan Umanzor, who could not have been better. Keeping our interest in mind, he adviced us every step of the way, resulting in selling our home super fast at an unexpectedly good price, and also saved for us significantly by accepting a reduced commission. We don't think we could have found such an excellent agent on our own. Going with Clever was the best choice all around. Thank you!",2021-07-01,5

Clever Real Estate,"I was planning to downsize by selling my 4br house and buying a 2br townhouse and I wanted to save money on the agent's fees while trying to get a rebate on my home buying. I did some research online and found a few websites that offered what I was looking for. After doing further comparisons, I decided to go with Clever Real Estate since they offered the lowest agent's fees and at the same time they give a rebate on a home purchase.I was given a few agent names to choose from. From there I did my further research to find the ideal agent that can work with me to look for new homes and to sell my house. I then contacted the agent and we started to look for houses that I found online. After a couple of weeks, I finally found a nice townhouse and decided to buy it. After the contract was signed, we started to put our house for sale. There were a lot of showings within a week and we received a full price offer only after 7 days in the market. We finally closed on June 1 2021 and within a month I received a rebate check from Clever. I'm really happy with the whole process because I saved a lot of money on the agent's fees plus I also received a rebate on my new home purchase. I would recommend Clever to anybody who wants to save money selling their house as well as getting a cash back from buying a house.",2021-06-29,5

Clever Real Estate,"We highly recommend using Jason King to sell your house. With the current market we tried to sell without an agent, and became frustrated and ran out of time as we were ready to close on our new home out of state. After meeting & interviewing several agents, the night before we left town we called Jason to sell our house. He picked up the key from a neighbor the next morning, took pictures called us and we discussed several things and in less than 48 hours the house was listed and being shown. There were numerous showings and within 2 weeks we had 2 offers. Jason was extremely knowledgeable and patient in his explanations & recommendations during the negotiations and if we did not want to do what recommended he accepted our position.  He kept us informed throughout the due diligence process and the period before closing. He was there for a very entertaining closing. All went well! Having dealt with other realtors, I would never mention their names again or recommend them; however Jason is professional and top notch.  I have referred friends and neighbors to him and you should use him to sell your home!",2021-06-28,5

I don’t know if this is normal, but our agent had everything ready at lightning quick speed and we were in awe. Her communication, her ideas, and her plans were all solid and she very clearly communicated everything with us. The house was listed and we received multiple offers- allover asking.

Clever Real Estate,"I’m received the email to get my Clever Partner Agent Markus with eXp Realty. His response, "" I charge 3.6% commission on the listing side"". Clever sounds like BAIT and Switch"" operation that doesn't do much screening!He also said:Subject: Re: Meet Your Clever Agent Match 🤝 Markus: Clever is a challenging referral source.  I don't offer full service flat fee listings, but they keep connecting me. -  we should talk about what you want out of an agent - cheap and basic or an actual pro who knows how to close deals quickly for the most cash in your pocket.  Markus I sent the above email back to Clever. I said I would give them another chance and now have a agent that understands the Clever model and agrees to abide by the rules. I may need to adjust the rating up or down later depending on the service.Today I got an email from Gary my new agent that Clever referred that said ""in this market, for the extreme discounted commission you agreed to by using Clever Realty, we don't feel we can be of any service to you at this time.  Good luck to you.""",2021-03-25,2

Clever Real Estate,"It was totally by accident that I was directed to the Clever website while in my search for a real estate agent/company to assist me in selling my home. I was very hesitant to move forward in the process with Clever Real Estate, it just sounded to good to be true. I kept thinking, ""what's the catch""? I did my research until I had proven to myself that it was the ""real deal"". THANK GOD I DID! The Clever team was very quick to respond and the same day I was put in touch with two very qualified real estate agents from my local area. I met with both and moved forward with Beckman Properties from Appleton, WI. Vicky Beckman was outstanding in getting my house listed, staged and professionally photographed. In three days we had 19 showings and seven offers, ALL ABOVE ASKING PRICE!!! We settled on a very attractive cash offer. As you can tell from my testimony above, I am a believer in Clever Real Estate and the partnering program they offer. Clever not only facilitated me with an outstanding local agent (Beckman Properties), they were also able to save me thousands of dollars in selling costs. Is this program that the Clever Real Estate team offers going to be for everyone, that I don't know... what I do know for sure is that it was a winner for me. Thanks so much to all parties involved!

I was matched with a realtor that was fairly close to my location named Scott Russell from Scott Russel Realty. He was extremely knowledgable and I accepted him as my realtor right away. I was very suprised at the quality of agent that I was matched with. I had a home in a very tricky area to sell and there were many homes sitting on market for longer than 90 days. Scott Russell explained to me how the Clever process worked and it really was a 1% seller fee + whatever the buyers agent fee was 2.5-3% for a total expenditure of 3.5-4%. Despite COVID and the tough market were in, we sold my house for only $2,000 less of my target sales price. As a bonus the buyers agent percentage was at 2.5%. I only had to pay a total of 3.5% which is unheard of. I had just enough money to cover the costs. If I did not use Clever, I would not have been able to afford to get out of my house and I would've had to short sale. This service is not a gimmick (even though it does seem that way at first). I had contacted other companies similar to Clever before I found them that promised lower commissions but the lowest offer I got from other companies was 2.5%. Scott Russell was the most knowledgeable and straight-forward agent I have ever worked with. I highly recommend Clever to people who are looking to save money on real estate commissions without sacrificing having a good agent. I will not need to use Clever again because I found such a good agent to work with but if I move to another area, I would not hesitate to use the service again for selling a home.",2020-10-06,5

Clever Real Estate,Clever had realtors contact us and the first one that called was amazing! We went with him! He gave top dollar service for a bottom dollar price. We feel so lucky to have had his experience during the sale of our home. I think this type of discount service should be more common. Throwing away money on closing costs is just hard to swallow. The only reason I have this a four as because even after we had spoken with our realtor and selected him clever kept contacting us with other realtors even after we told them we were all set. It seemed like there was a lag in their system and we found it super annoying. Other than initially signing up and selecting our realtor we didn’t have any other use or need to contact clever. That is a testimony to our realtor...so not sure how much credit clever actually deserves. But overall we are happy and grateful we went this route. No regrets!,2020-10-05,4

I connected with a Clever POC who  explained how the process worked and then provided me with contact information for two different agents, who both appeared to be great professionals when I spoke with them to determine which one I wanted to work with.  Clever followed-up to make sure I was able to connect with an agent and that everything was going smoothly.  The agent I ended up selecting, Cristen Treu, was exceptional at her job.  She kept me in the loop on everything without prompting and went above and beyond what I expected.  Specifically, the day before closing, the buyers requested that I have the lawn mowed.  I didn't live locally and it would have been difficult to find someone on short notice, so Cristen ended up personally taking care of it.  By the end, I wanted to increase her commission. Ultimately, I was unable to do so because we were closing the next day and it was too late to change the real estate transaction documents to incorporate the commission increase, but I definitely would have done it if I could.",2020-04-14,5

I saw many options, but Clever was the only one offering full service at a reduced rate, since I had nothing to lose - I called and met with three realtors before selecting one.     From the day we listed my house, to the day of closing was 34 days. I couldn’t be happier with the ease of selling, and the money I saved.  I would highly recommend talking to them if you are considering selling your home!",2020-02-24,5

He come to view our home & had a professional photographer take pics within a few days! His marketing strategy & contacts within the industry were great. We had our home under contract in 3 days with an over- ask price after receiving multiple offers! Clever & their agent were incredible! Why pay 6-7% for a full service agent when you get a full service agent through clever for substantially less!! It's a no brainer!!Clever's program was great!!",2020-02-12,5
Clever Real Estate,"It was great working with Clever to find an agent in our area to help us sell our home. They refer agents who have great ratings on other sights, and have a certain amount of years of experience which helps narrow down our choices.  It's also great knowing the realtors will accept a lower commission in order for the homeowners to be able to keep more of their equity.  In this age of home ownership of purchasing a property, or selling, it helps to keep more equity in your pocket, but still be able to have a professional realtor on your side. Our realtor Bebe, in Fairfield, Ca, was great to work with and a wonderful person. If it weren't for Clever referring us, I don't think we would have found her.",2020-02-11,5

Jessica did her research before our initial meeting and she explained how she planned to advertise and sell our home.  She kept us informed every step of the way and had three solid offers in the first three days she posted our house.  We sold rapidly because of her expertise and attention to detail.  We were so pleased we retained Jessica to help us find our next home.  We were thoroughly represented and are totally satisfied with our experience.,2020-01-31,5

Clever Real Estate,SK Robinson was phenomenal. Clever lives up to its name!,2019-11-04,5
Clever Real Estate,"Clever brought me into contact with several experienced realtors willing to help me list my home for just a 1% commission. I had overpaid when I bought the house due to having an inexperienced relative be my realtor, so I really needed to sell as high as possible while economizing on the expenses involved. I thought that would mean getting minimal service from an inexperienced realtor with a no-name agency, but I was more than pleasantly surprised to find that I met several with lots of experience working for national agencies. The one I contracted with gave me lots of attention and was especially helpful in negotiating the finer points of the deal to my advantage. I highly recommend using Clever to list your home.",2019-11-03,5
Clever Real Estate,"I give it an average experience.  Although the home sold in 5 or so months, it was difficult to contact the realtor.  With that being said, I guess since he was working for 1% that would be expected.Just an average experience.",2019-11-01,3

Clever Real Estate,"I had an unsuccessful 1st realtor that had my listing for 2 months with no offers. I found Clever while searching the net for a new realtor. I liked the concept and read the reviews.  As soon as I completed the contact form I received two calls immediately. I spoke to two very interested realtors and both realtors were very impressive in their knowledge of my area. I ultimately choose Carlos Villegas of The Royal Group. We just hit it off and I was just impressed with his knowledge of the area, his positive energy and dedication to getting my house sold quickly. Having the right realtor who actively listens to your needs makes a huge difference. Once I completed my remodel, he got a photographer in and then listed the home on Sat. He scheduled an open house 24 hrs after the MLS went live and had 5 offers within 48hrs of the open house. I selected the buyer and we opened escrow five days after the open house. The entire process has been positive, Carlos is an extremely professional and caring person. I couldn't be happier with the service I received and highly recommend both Carlos and Clever.",2019-10-30,5

I would highly recommended Kathy to anyone who is in need of a real estate agent.",2019-10-30,5
Clever Real Estate,,2019-10-30,5
Clever Real Estate,"I have never used a realtor before, I have always paid a flat fee to get my listing on the MLS.  I have sold numerous properties and have been extremely happy with my results.  However the last time I sold a property, I got a full price offer (as usual), but after accepting, I received another offer for $10,000 over asking price.  I lost out on the $10K, because I said yes too soon.I decided to try a 1% listing agent this time to manage everything for me.  I have been extremely happy with Marcy, my agent.  She has gone above and beyond for me in every way.  She has been there for the inspection and the appraisal to make sure things went smoothly.  She also negotiated a counter offer when things went south during the inspection process.  She is a keeper.  I will use her again in the future.",2019-10-30,5
Clever Real Estate,,2019-10-29,4
Clever Real Estate,I think realtors make too much money to sell houses! I'm so glad I found Clever Real Estate! They found a great realtor that helped me sell my house for a quarter of the amount of the realtor fees.,2019-10-29,5
Clever Real Estate,"Clever is a great concept, however in my case the first two realtors that were assigned to sell my home weren't interested due to the low profit margin. Luckily the 3rd agent was interested and took it on. This is a good way to get your property listed on the MLS but don't expect your assigned realtor to spend a whole lot of time focusing on selling your home. Realtors can make 3 times as much money selling through someone not listed through Clever. I took it upon myself to take good pictures of the home and did a little Facebook marketing to get more foot traffic through our home. All in all it worked out great. We sold our home and saved about $8,000 in the process.",2019-10-29,4

Clever Real Estate,"Initially, I couldn’t believe that we could get a quality real estate agent for a fraction of the price. We interviewed multiple real estate agents and chose Steve Roake through Clever not only because of the price, but because he was a great real estate agent. Also, Clever will send out multiple agents for anyone to interview and will continue sending new ones until the owners feel comfortable with their choice (we didn’t need to do that since the agent they initially sent out was so great). Since we chose a Clever agent, we received the same exact services we would if we had paid three times the amount of money it would cost us to sell our home. We would definitely recommend Clever. They clearly only work with the best quality agents and will cost you a fraction of the price.",2019-10-26,5

I really appreciated that. She promised it would sell quickly....She sold my house in eight days! I was told the average time on the market is 60 days. It was technically on the market for only 8 days, the rest of the time was paperwork. The reduced agent commission, which was the original reason I chose Clever, was a lifesaver. Thank you so much.  I definitely recommend Clever, and Loretta.",2019-10-06,5
Clever Real Estate,Remarkable service. I was able to sell my home in about five months despite it being a buyers market. Happy with clever in teaming me with a real estate agent and also about the seller agent’s flat rate commission. Saved us much!

Clever Real Estate,"Clever Real Estate is a very professional company who provided me with one of the most knowledgeable and hard working real estate agents I have ever known.  Her name is Laura Whitney  from Keller Williams in Destin, Florida.She always knew the answer to clear up problems that came up during the sale process and was very friendly, courteous, and a true professional.The closing attorneys discovered two permits for work that had been done on the house that were still open.  One was for installation if a new front door, side light windows, overhead window,  a front storm door and a back storm door in 2010  The other permit was for installing a new heating system in 2014.  For some reason, these two permits had never been cleared or closed.  Laura worked with the contractors and successfully received closure on both permits prior to closing.Laura is a very knowledgeable realtor and works very hard for her clients.

Clever Real Estate,"I was teamed up with Michael Brown through Clever. This was the absolute worst experience I have had with a realtor. I current own 6 properties and do a fair amount of buying-flipping, etc.,  so I am somewhat familiar with the real estate world.  This realtor was rude and unprofessional from day one. He immediately wanted to lower the price of my house, even though it was priced very competitively with the other properties currently listed in our neighborhood. He has had our listing since January and only shown it twice in 6 months. He also refused to let me out of the contract even after repeated requests from me stating that I did not want to sell it at this time and that I was extremely unpleased with his service. The only thing he would agree to do is remove it from the MLS but informed me the contract would remain in full force. I have never asked any realtor to end a contract and never encountered a realtor who was not in contact with you. Mr. Brown never contacted me with any updates unless I reached out to him and then it was several days and sometimes took me reading out a second time to him to get any response. I tried Clever hoping to save money, now I have wasted 6 months,mortgage payments and no results. I will gladly pay the full real estate commission moving forward. I would give no stars for this realtor if it were possible. Lesson learned, you definitely get what you pay for!",2019-08-12,1
Clever Real Estate,I used clever to sell my house in Apopka Florida. I was very please.  The other agents would not budge from6 per cent commission s   The only issue was my agents office was 45 minutes away so He was not around as much as I would have liked,2019-08-07,5
Clever Real Estate,Claudia did a great job and even helped with our very strict HOA issues that came up when we were out-of-town. Her communication was clear and she listened and made any changes I wanted on the listing. We got a full asking price that was optimistic and I was grateful she supported us in it. The first agent clever sent us was disappointing and he talked as if our house was nothing special. He said the “S” word multiple times in front of my young children at home and spent most of the time name dropping. He suggested a listing price that was 20k under what we sold for. I liked the idea of clever and asked for another agent and couldn’t have been happier with her.,2019-08-07,5

I hope to continue working with him in the future.Our sellers agent was good.  She had someone hold open houses and made brochures after I had asked.

Clever Real Estate,"Our realtor was Chris Doss with Clever.  It was clear from the start that he wanted to devote the minimum amount of time to our listing. We rewrote the MLS paragraph ourselves after reading Chris’ effortless write-up. He put a lot of pressure on us to list below what we knew our house was worth. Initially, $15,000 lower, and then as much as $35,000 lower at times when showings were slow. He told us repeatedly that our house wasn’t worth what we wanted, and even if we got an offer for that amount, it would never appraise for that amount. (We did get exactly that amount because we stubbornly held out for it, and it did appraise for that amount. We were under contract in 30 days.) Chris was extremely pushy and direct about us taking the first offer that came in when we weren’t comfortable with it. He also never emailed us offers until we specifically asked him to do so so that we could look them over. He always made us feel as if this was asking a lot on our part. Some offers we never even saw, only heard of through him over the phone. We would later find out that offers conveyed to us over the phone left out many important details, hence the reason we started asking him to email us all offers for us to look at for ourselves. The first weekend our house was on the market it was a holiday weekend, and unbeknownst to us Chris took the weekend off after we got 4 offers on our house. He ignored our texts and phone calls that weekend. We weren’t able to address them until Monday morning when Chris checked back in, and at that point the offers were expiring that evening. About 99% of the time Chris made us feel like we were highly inconveniencing him, and that he didn’t want to devote anymore time to us than he had to. Chris’ guidance though the process of selling our home was nil. Educating us about the process — nil. Communication, a negative nil. He does get an A+ for selling himself very well for our initial phone call and interview—beware, he is a very smooth talker and salesman. Chris is the 6th realtor that we’ve worked with over decades of house sales and purchases. Fortunately, we had the privilege of working with a very professional realtor for our last house sale and purchase, and we are embarrassed to say that we took that level of professionalism and skill for granted. Selling your home is a stressful process and the wrong realtor can ratchet up that stress by 100x. Get a realtor that makes you feel like a valued client and that they have your best interests at heart.",2019-07-16,1
Clever Real Estate,"We had a very nice experience selling our home with Clever.  We were matched with a ""full service"" realtor - We did not sense any differences in the level of service in the level of service in spite of the fact that she was working for a lower commission.

They both even came to settlement.  Sharon and Jill went above and beyond for us!  We are big Clever fans!",2019-07-15,5

We successfully sold our home with a top-notch agent, at a great commission rate.  You would be silly not to use Clever if they are available in your real estate market!",2019-07-12,5
Clever Real Estate,My experience was not so good!  I emailed them about selling my house and responded someone would get back with me soon. The next day I get email giving me an agent to contact.  I emailed back and said this agent phone contact was in another state.  I am in Texas.  I then received another email giving me another agent contact.  We made contact made an appointment for the next day to meet.  The agent called me back and said she just signed up with Clever and didn't read all the paperwork.  She then asked if I was buying another house.  I told her no only listing my house.  She was very nice but did not want to take my listing because she did not want to do it.   She said she would consider doing it if I was listing and buying a home.  My experince was not good.  I get the feeling they don't have any agents in my area.  So Clever was not for me.,2019-07-11,1
Clever Real Estate,"My Clever real estate agent, Mike Warren, provided me the exact same level of service as any full-commission agent.

Clever Real Estate,"Well, to be totally honest, I was very unimpressed with Clever at the beginning. The first agent recommendation was for a gentleman 35 miles from our area and sold houses way above our price range. I just didn't think he would bother with making an effort. When I called for another recommendation - specifically asking for someone closer to our area and price range - I got another similar to the first. I really wanted to give Clever a shot, so I asked for a 3rd recommendation. Once again, this agent # 3 Shaunette Young, had an office far from our area. However, after speaking to her on the phone giving her a grilling about whether she knew our area, she assured me she lived in our county and would make a 100% effort to help us sell. Shaunette turned out to be awesome! She knows her stuff. We've bought a few pieces of real estate, but this was our first sale, so we needed just a bit of hand-holding. Shaunette helped us with many things,including getting the house ready for sale, establishing a selling price, etc. We listed on a Thursday afternoon and accepted an offer ABOVE asking price that Sunday afternoon. Shaunette also helped with the closing when a snag occurred. She is very knowledgeable in her profession and the local real estate market. Highly recommend Shaunette!

Clever Real Estate,"OUTSTANDING option to conventional real estate sales and we saved a considerable amount on the reduced commission.Having said that, the best part of the entire process was the local Realtor they put us in touch with: Dominic Campo (Campo Real Estate, Pawnee, IL). Dominic is professional, enthusiastic, has a lot of great ideas, including marketing strategies, and - most importantly - he is successful. In our area, the market is so saturated with upper bracket properties, it has become a buyer's market. In the vast majority of cases, the only game plan the other Realtors have to compete is to lower the price, which affects the seller. Dominic had several 'out of the box' ideas and, while the other properties remained for sale, he sold our home within 16 days. We close in two weeks and will be headed to a new home and another chapter in our lives. For that, we are deeply appreciative for Clever Real Estate, and Dominic Campo.",2019-06-19,5
Clever Real Estate,"I have to admit that I was a apprehensive when I first encountered Clever. While researching how to find the best realtor/service to list my home for sale, i came across Clever in an online search.After reading the reviews and searching desperately to ensure that the recommendations posted were not ""self-written,"" I filled out the application and was immediately contacted by two of their sales agents. Both were experienced and fully qualified. I spoke and met with both and selected Chris Doss, who I did an awesome job. Chris made immediate contact and came by to meet me personally. We discussed the potential sales price once the updates were done. Chris was able to see my vision unlike other agents I met with. It took a couple of weeks to complete the updates to the property and in that time the Clever support team reached out to see if there was a problem. It felt reassuring that someone else was watching the time on the progress of listing the house.When I told other agents that I was considering listing with an agent from Clever, some said that the process with companies like Clever means that I will have to do a lot of the leg work (showing, paperwork, etc.). The truth is that the only paperwork I had to complete was the online contracts and disclosures and the closing/signing. The showings were automated with potential buyers' agents scheduling via an online application. SEAMLESS!Once the house was listed, we immediately saw a tremendous interest and that evening had three solid offers, all significantly over the asking price. We closed 30 days later with no major issues and I saw a significant increase not only because of the offers but from the reduced selling fee. I've purchased and sold three other properties and this one was by far the best experience. I would recommend Clever (and Chris Doss, GA realtor) to anyone looking for a more innovative, efficient, and cost-effective way of selling their home while keeping more of their money in their pocket.",2019-06-17,5

I ended up paying more to get professional photos, 20 photos instead of 10 and she did do an open house. I felt the level of service should have been indicated up front.

Clever Real Estate,"I was a little skeptical when I saw the ad. My husband and I were selling a rental home and knew it would be a quick sale and didn't want to pay 3% when we just bought it 5 yrs ago. I contacted a Clever rep, he emailed me contact info for two realtors in my area. We picked one and sure enough only paid a flat $3000. We did choose to pay our realtor an extra fee of $1000 because we wanted to make sure she put in the time. This was optional and we diacussed it beforehand. Realtors really dont make much when all expenses are considered at a flat $3000. Now that we've signed I can say Clever was a perfect choice for us and they hold true to their advertising. It saved us thousands that we now have in our bank account that we wouldn't have had without using Clever.",2019-05-21,5

We met with a bunch of agents from different agencies/services, and she was the only one to do research before meeting with us, finding comps and coming up with a plan.  Karen also provided us with practical no-nonsense advice when touring our house, telling us what should be fixed/painted/etc.  Other agents just kept complimenting our house trying to get on our good side, without actually pointing out any deficiencies or ways to improve it before listing.  Karen talked with us about creating a plan to sell the house, and she arranged for the photographer and took care of the listing.  It only took 3 weeks for us to get an offer, and Karen did a great job with the negotiations to get us a good selling price.

Clever Real Estate,For the leads I was able to convert into listings the transactions were great. My issue is most of the leads are very skeptical of how this works and think its a scam. I feel that you should poll the agents you work with the see who wants to offer full service listings and advertise that it is a full service listing for 1%. The only think I am not offering with these listings are an open house. Mostly because in my market they are not needed and the house will sell quickly. Otherwise it is a full service listing with professional measurements and photos. I feel that if the people realize this then they wont be as skeptical.,2018-12-28,4

We met him on Tuesday, the listing went live on Thursday (for about 15K more then I thought it should) open house on Sunday, house went under contract Sunday, for full price!

Clever Real Estate,"We had an agent. I gave her credit for the new home we bought. She was going to help us sell our house because we gave her basically free money. I happened to see a Clever ad. Since  Zillow says to interview more than one agent, we submitted the Clever form. We interviewed the Clever agent. We interviewed 2 more. Out of all the agents we interviewed, the Clever Real Estate agent was the very best. He was more knowledgeable, more helpful and got everything right including price.  We dropped the other agent (who was supposedly our friend by now) and went with the Clever agent. Best decision, period. Wish I gave him credit for the new home we bought, also. He deserved it. Definitely Clever is no doubt the way to go. In my opinion, a person selling their house would be making a big mistake if they did not use this method of selling their home.  It is a no-brainer. At least interview their agent. We are very happy with the result. Saved a lot of money. With this agent I can truly say, because of him, we made more money. That's a fact!",2018-05-22,5
